# Five-Day Forecast

## Description

This application was developed to generate a five-day forecast as well as current weather from Server Side API's and display on the screen. The application will also save recent searches and generate buttons with past searches. The weather will display temperature, humidity, wind speed, and an icon showing precipitation/cloudiness. This application is an exercise in using serverside API's with fetch requests using jQuery.
